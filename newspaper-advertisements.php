<p>HE WHO LIVES IN A POWDER-HOUSE,<br />
SHOULD NOT THROW FIREBRANDS.<br />
<i>“ Parents—Relations—Friends!"</i></p>
<p>“THE Facietrace which I employ," says Mr. Peale, "is the invention of the ingenious Haw-kins, of Philadelphia. The success of this was the occasion of several others to adopt as much of the principle as they could, in evading the patent right, yet in fact they were obliged to omit the principal part, and upon which the whole merit of the invention rests." This last assertion entire-ly exonerates and acquits "several others" of having infringed Mr. Hawkins's patent; for they have omitted that part "upon which the whole merit of the invention rests." It is therefore unne- cessary to mention, that the pentagraph, the prin- cipal mathematical instrument used by Mr. Haw- kins and "others," was invented probably a cen-tury before the  birth of Mr. Hawkins :  That the said pentagraph has for many years been employed in different ways, for taking profile likenesses in Europe and America; one method, with a description and plate, may be seen in the Ladies' Museum, vol. 3d, published in London in the year 1799: That there are several profiles in the United States, nay, in the city of Balti-more, taken in Europe by some of those methods.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkins applied the pentagraph in a manner different from any before him, viz. by passing a part of it over, and in contact with the face. Myself and "several others“  conceived this method very objectionable; first, on account of the indelicacy of passing part of the instru-ment between the lips of a delicate lady, after its having passed in contact with the hair and nose, and between the lips of thousands probably some of them, and possibly the very last, infected with a communicable disease; and secondly, the derangement of the features, occasioned by the touch of the instrument passing over the face—We, therefore, devised a method, for which we have a patent, at least free from those objections, by which we can trace the human face with "mathematical correctness" without touching it.</p>
<p>I TODD, in behalf 
	of Day, Bache and Todd, the patentees.
	Although I have never taken the 80th part of 345,000 profiles of different people; yet it re-quires no extraordinary degree of vanity to sub-mit the comparative correctness, neatness and elegance of the profiles I have now (and I have many) or may hereafter have in my possession, to the decision of those who may, with or without prejudice, visit my room over the post office. </p>
