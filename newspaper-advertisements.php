<p>HE WHO LIVES IN A POWDER-HOUSE,<br />
SHOULD NOT THROW FIREBRANDS.<br />
<i>“ Parents—Relations—Friends!"</i></p>
<p>“THE Facietrace which I employ," says Mr. Peale, "is the invention of the ingenious Haw-kins, of Philadelphia. The success of this was the occasion of several others to adopt as much of the principle as they could, in evading the patent right, yet in fact they were obliged to omit the principal part, and upon which the whole merit of the invention rests." This last assertion entire-ly exonerates and acquits "several others" of having infringed Mr. Hawkins's patent; for they have omitted that part "upon which the whole merit of the invention rests." It is therefore unne- cessary to mention, that the pentagraph, the prin- cipal mathematical instrument used by Mr. Haw- kins and "others," was invented probably a cen-tury before the  birth of Mr. Hawkins :  That the said pentagraph has for many years been employed in different ways, for taking profile likenesses in Europe and America; one method, with a description and plate, may be seen in the Ladies' Museum, vol. 3d, published in London in the year 1799: That there are several profiles in the United States, nay, in the city of Balti-more, taken in Europe by some of those methods.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkins applied the pentagraph in a manner different from any before him, viz. by passing a part of it over, and in contact with the face. Myself and "several others“  conceived this method very objectionable; first, on account of the indelicacy of passing part of the instru-ment between the lips of a delicate lady, after its having passed in contact with the hair and nose, and between the lips of thousands probably some of them, and possibly the very last, infected with a communicable disease; and secondly, the derangement of the features, occasioned by the touch of the instrument passing over the face—We, therefore, devised a method, for which we have a patent, at least free from those objections, by which we can trace the human face with "mathematical correctness" without touching it.</p>
<p>I TODD, in behalf 
	of Day, Bache and Todd, the patentees.
	Although I have never taken the 80th part of 345,000 profiles of different people; yet it re-quires no extraordinary degree of vanity to sub-mit the comparative correctness, neatness and elegance of the profiles I have now (and I have many) or may hereafter have in my possession, to the decision of those who may, with or without prejudice, visit my room over the post office. </p>

    <p>STRIKING and cheap LIKENESSES, by W. BACHE, and T.
    NIXON; who engage to furnish any
    per-son that will favour them with half
    an hour’s sitting, an elegant painting and
    speaking Likeness for the small sum of
    Two Dollars and Twenty-five Cents.–
    Also, Profiles in a new and superiour
    style, elegantly shaded, for Fifty Cents. <br>
    The publick are assured that this is
    something entirely different from any thing
    heretofore attempted in this place. It is
    therefore hoped they will not deem it
    be-neath their attention, but call and see
    spe-cimens of the work, at Major McCLEL-LAN’S, next-door to Col.
    Macomber’s Tavern, near the Bridge,
    Main-Street.
    December 22, 1809.

  <p>Painters and Profileists, at Mrs. Cottrell’s, No.
  128, Thames street, return their grateful thanks to
  the Ladies and Gentlemen of Newport, for the liberal patronage they have already experienced; which
  together with a view to the accommodation of those
  who have been prevented by engagements or indisposition from sitting for their Likenesses, induces them
  to prolong their stay in town for two or three weeks.
  By unexampled and highly flattering success that had attended them, they are emboldened to
  say that their performances, both in point of likeness and elegance of extinction, surpasses any thing
  of the kind that has hitherto been attempted in
  Rhode-Island,—and respectfully invite the Ladies
  and Gentlemen of Newport, to avail themselves of the
  opportunity now offered, to get a speaking
  Likenes-ses for the small sum of two dollars, in
  colours, twen- ty-five cents shaded, or twenty-five
  cent a set cut in paper. May 16.
