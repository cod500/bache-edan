                                    with no
                                    apparent training as an artist. Yet from 1803 to 1812, he pursued a prolific and
                                    successful
                                    career as an itinerant maker of silhouette portraits, traveling up and down the eastern

                                    from Maine to Virginia, and further south to Louisiana and Cuba. Working sporadically

                                    nine-year period, he produced thousands of shaded profiles with the aid of a patented

                                    and
                                    quick to make, silhouettes captured the likenesses of a broad cross-section of society,

                                    those who could afford no other form of portrait.
